# Time to Event Data

# Time from cancer diagnosis until death 
# Time from pacemaker implant until battery depletion 
# Time from starting a quit-smoking program until person resume smoking 
# Time from kidney transplant to graft loss


#  survival package 
# survminer package for ggplot2-based visualization of survival analysis results
# Surv() -  create a survival object
# survfit() - fit survival curves (Kaplan-Meier estimates)
# survdiff() - perform log-rank test comparing survival curves
# coxph() - compute the Cox proportional hazards model

# Kaplan-Meier plots : visualize survival curves
# Log-rank test : compare  survival curves of two or more groups
# Cox proportional hazards regression : describe the effect of variables on survival. 

# survival probability
# hazard  

# The Kaplan-Meier (KM) : non-parametric method used to estimate the survival probability from observed survival times
