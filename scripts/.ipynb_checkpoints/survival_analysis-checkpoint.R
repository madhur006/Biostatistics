#  survival package 
# survminer package for ggplot2-based visualization of survival analysis results
# Surv() -  create a survival object

# survdiff() - perform log-rank test comparing survival curves
# coxph() - compute the Cox proportional hazards model

# Kaplan-Meier plots : visualize survival curves
# Log-rank test : compare  survival curves of two or more groups
# Cox proportional hazards regression : describe the effect of variables on survival.

# Cox proportional-hazards model : regression model commonly used statistical in medical research 
# for investigating the association between the survival time of patients and one or more predictor variables.
#  Kaplan-Meier curves and logrank tests - are univariate analysis

# Cox proportional hazards regression analysis : quantitative predictor variables and for categorical variables. 
# Cox regression model extends survival analysis methods to assess simultaneously the effect of several risk factors on survival time.

# A covariate with hazard ratio > 1 (i.e.: b > 0) is called bad prognostic factor
# A covariate with hazard ratio < 1 (i.e.: b < 0) is called good prognostic factor
